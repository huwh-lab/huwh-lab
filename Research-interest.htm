									  <p>My  research interest focuses on the gene regulation (NIBP, RGS4 and TCF4) and  signal transduction (NFkB, protein trafficking and  G protein signaling). I utilize innovative gene/cell therapy for the  translational medicine to treat infectious/inflammatory diseases and genetic neurodevelopmental  disorders. My overarching goal is to explore the translational application of  improved CRISPR/Cas genome editors and develop innovative target cell-specific  gene therapy in both preclinical animal studies and clinical trials. Also, I  aim to elucidate the role and mechanism of NIBP, a novel protein I discovered(<a href="#_ENREF_32" title="Hu, 2005 #128">Hu et al. 2005</a>), in regulating NFkB  signaling and <em>trans</em>-Golgi network(<a href="#_ENREF_6" title="Bodnar, 2020 #2">Bodnar et al.  2020</a>). NIBP may serve as a novel  anti-viral restriction factor to eradicate/prevent virus infection (such as HIV,  ZIKV, SARS-COV-2). Elucidating NIBP's functions may drive discovery and broad translational  advances in neural development, adult neurogenesis, neuronal polarization,  neuroregeneration, neuroinflammation, metabolic syndrome and tumorigenesis.I have established advantageous novel animal models, human  induced pluripotent stem cells (<strong>iPSC</strong>)-derived vascularized microglia-containing  cerebral organoids (<strong>vMCO</strong>) and CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene/cell therapy  platform. I have the vision, expertise,  and leadership skills to accomplish these goals.

                                        <li><strong>T cell-targeting gene therapy: </strong>HIV/AIDS remains  a major public health concern,  affecting &gt;39 million  people worldwide. In the era  of antiretroviral treatment (ART), HIV remains incurable due to viral  persistence and latency. HIV-1 infected individuals under long-term suppressive  ART develop various comorbidities such as precocious aging, neurocognitive  disorders (HAND), cardiovascular diseases, and others.  ART does not eliminate the integrated and silent HIV-1  provirus in latently infected  cells (CD4 T cells) and tissues, such as the lymphoid tissue,  gastrointestinal/genital tract, bone marrow, or brain.  Cessation of ART leads to rapid viral rebound, even after many years of viral suppression. Novel approaches to permanently silence or completely eliminate HIV-1 latent  proviruses are urgently  needed to achieve  a &ldquo;sterilizing&rdquo; HIV cure. CRISPR/Cas genome editing strategy in  preclinical animal studies including ours have shown a promise for eradicating HIV-1  provirus. Many viral and non-viral technologies have been developed for delivery of genome editors, which can be cDNA,  mRNA, protein or ribonucleoprotein (RNP). RNP can be delivered via  electroporation, nanoparticles (NP) or lentivirus-like particles (LVLP). In these  projects, NP and VLP are used to deliver HIV-specific RNP because it does not involve the reverse transcription and random integration. Our approach involves  CD4-targeted delivery of  all-in-one Cas12f/multiplexed gRNA array for both <em>in vitro </em>and <em>in vivo </em>studies  including humanized mice.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Microglia-targeted CRISPR/Cas editor for a cure of NeuroHIV: </strong>Although ART has greatly improved  survival rates of HIV patients, &gt;50% HIV-infected patients will still  develop various degrees of HAND. Brain myeloid cells (BMC) including microglia  (MG) and perivascular macrophages have been extensively investigated for their  contribution to NeuroHIV persistence, chronic neuroinflammation and HAND. Thus,  eradication of HIV provirus in MG is a critical step towards cure of NeuroHIV.  Since AAV gene therapy is most promising with  thousands of ongoing  clinical trials, significant efforts to minimize  the CRISPR/Cas editors  for fitting into AAV size limit have identified several miniature Cas editors such as Cas12f, Cas12j  and Cas13x. A scientific gap in this field is lack of ideal AAV serotypes (AAV-BM)  with high efficiency of both crossing  the BBB (AAV-B) and targeting  MG (AAV-M) <em>in vivo</em>. The current AAV-B serotypes have high efficiency to transduce neurons,  astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, but have limited  ability of transducing MG. In contrast, several AAV-M serotypes have been  identified for their efficient tropism to MG in the literature and our  preliminary studies. None of these  AAV-M can cross BBB efficiently. Therefore, three strategies are employed  to fill in this critical  gap: 1) Developing novel Exo-ERVLP technologies for endogenous scissor gene delivery to MG via  AAV-B sustained gene therapy;  2) Screening AAV-BM serotypes in non-human primate  (NHP) for SIV eradication; and  3) Screening AAV-BM serotypes in humanized MG mouse model and vascularized  MG-containing cerebral organoids (vMCO) for HIV eradication.</li>

For example, in immune cells NF<span style="color:black">&#954;</span>B  signaling generates pro-inflammatory mediators that may worsen GI inflammation,  but in intestinal epithelial cells it maintains intestinal mucosal integrity. In colonic smooth muscle cells, NF<span style="color:black">&#954;</span>B mediates  inflammation-induced contractile inhibition. The roles of NF<span style="color:black">&#954;</span>B  signaling within the ENS are largely unknown. NIBP is highly  expressed at both mRNA and protein levels in neurons of brain and gut alike.  NIBP knockdown in an enteric neuronal cell line inhibits cytokine-induced NF<span style="color:black">&#954;</span>B  activation and neuronal differentiation.
